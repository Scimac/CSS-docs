CSS preprocessors and postprocessors are tools that enhance the capabilities of writing and managing CSS styles. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **CSS Preprocessors:**
   - **Definition:** CSS preprocessors are tools that extend the functionality of CSS by introducing features not natively available in traditional CSS.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets):** Sass is a popular CSS preprocessor that introduces features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It has two syntaxes: Sass (indented syntax) and SCSS (Sassy CSS).
     - **LESS:** LESS is another preprocessor that provides features like variables, nested rules, and mixins. It is often considered similar to Sass but has a different syntax.

2. **CSS Postprocessors:**
   - **Definition:** CSS postprocessors, also known as postprocessors or autoprefixers, come into play after you've written your CSS. They automatically apply vendor prefixes to CSS rules, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Autoprefixer:** Autoprefixer is a popular postprocessor that adds or removes vendor prefixes based on the official W3C specifications. It eliminates the need for developers to manually add prefixes for different browsers.
     - **PostCSS:** PostCSS is a tool that can do more than just autoprefixing. It is a toolchain for transforming styles with JS plugins. Autoprefixer is one of the plugins, and there are others that offer additional functionality.

**Comparison:**
- **Timing:** Preprocessors are applied before the CSS is served to the browser, while postprocessors are applied after the CSS is generated.
- **Functionality:** Preprocessors introduce new syntax and features, allowing for more maintainable and modular CSS. Postprocessors, on the other hand, focus on ensuring compatibility by adding vendor prefixes.
- **Examples:** Sass and LESS are examples of preprocessors, while Autoprefixer and PostCSS (with autoprefixer plugin) are examples of postprocessors.

In many projects, both preprocessors and postprocessors are used together to enhance the development and deployment of CSS styles.
