The CSS Flexbox layout is a one-dimensional layout system that is useful for distributing space and aligning items within a container. Flexbox works well with all types of display devices and screen sizes.

## Flex-Containers

- `Div`s can be changed to **flex-containers** using css --- `display:flex;`
- Once a div is changed to `display:flex;`, the immediatly subsiquesnt elements turns into flex too.
- Instead of worrying about block/inline elements flexbox worries about a main axis and a cross axis.
  - **Main axis and cross axis** changes according to the flex direction (row or column).![[Pasted image 20230409192803.png]]
### Flex-Direction

- If the direction of the newly created flex `div` is `row`, then the children --> `flex-items` will have a direction of `column` and vice versa.
- controlled by - `flex-direction: row/column/row-reverse/column-reverse`

### Flex Wrap

- Controlled using `flex-wrap:nowrap/wrap`. 
- controls the orientation of the children in the flex box.

### Flex-Flow

- Combines both `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` into one css property, a shorthand - 
	`flex-flow: row nowrap`

### Justify and Align (content/items?)

1. **justify-content** (works on more than one elements on main axis)
	- `justify-content` allows us to move the **MULTIPLE flex items** along the **main axis, which changes according to the flex direction (row or column)**.
	- flex-start is the default value. --- flex-end, center, space-between/evenly/around can also be used.
			 ![[Pasted image 20230409223922.png|200]]
			 
1. **align-items**
	- `align-items` allows us to move the flex items along the **cross axis**.
	- `stretch` (stretches the items to full flex-container height) is the default value --- flex-start/end, center, space-between/evenly/around, baseline can also be used.
			![[Pasted image 20230409225533.png|200]]
			
1. align-content (works on more than one set of flex-items on cross axis)
	- `align-content` is same as `justify-content`, except on cross axis.
	- `align-content` allows us to move the **MULTIPLE flex items** along the **main axis, which changes according to the flex direction (row or column)**.
	- flex-start is the default value. --- flex-end, center, space-between/evenly/around can also be used.

1. Justify items is applied to a container and has the below effects:
	- In block-level layouts, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis.
	- For absolutely-positioned elements, it aligns the items inside their containing block on the inline axis, accounting for the offset values of top, left, bottom, and right.
	- In table cell layouts, this property is ignored
	- **In flexbox layouts, this property is ignored**
	- In grid layouts, it aligns the items inside their grid areas on the inline axis

## Flex-items

- Flex-items are the immediate elements inside the flex-containers. We'll look for css properties that affect individual flex-items rather than the whole bunch.

### Flex-grow

- The `flex-grow` property is a property defined on a flex item and it tells the item how much of the extra space that item is allowed to take to fill its container.
- By default this property is set to 0 which means the item does not get any extra space.
- It is like a ratio of the rate with which the flex-items grow.
	```css
	.flex-item:nth-child(1) {
	  flex-grow: 1;
	}
	```
	  ![[Pasted image 20230409233423.png]]
 
 > `flex grow` only cares about the remaining space after all elements are added to the container.
 > Since by default our 3 elements take up 60% of the container size the remaining space to divide between the elements is only 40% of the container size. 
 
 > We can actually modify how this remaining space is calculated, though, by using `flex-basis`

### Flex-shrink

- The `flex-shrink` property is a property defined on a flex item and it tells the item how much should it shrink when less than required space is available. 
- By default this property is set to 1 which means the items shrink at similar pace.
	 ![[Pasted image 20230409234408.png|250]]

### Flex-basis

- The `flex-basis` property tells our flex container how much space the item is taking up in the container. 
- By default this is set to `auto` which means it just uses the `width` property of the element to calculate this.
- It acts like a `max-width` property when the `flex-grow` is 0 and `flex-shrink` is 1.

### Flex

- `flex` property is a short hand for defining the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` properties.
- `flex : 0 1 auto` is the default value [ `flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis` ]

### Align-self

- The `align-self` property specifies the alignment of the selected flex item inside a flex-container.
- It over-rides the `align-items` property of the flex-box for that specific flex-item.
	![[Pasted image 20230410000446.png|]]
- The default value is `auto`, and we can use all the justify-items values here.

### Justify-self

- There is no justify-self in flex-box, it is a grid property 😐
- we can use margin inline property or margin-left/right property (both are same thing btw).

### Order

- By default we can order elements in normal order or reverse order by using `flex-direction`, but we can also order individual elements with the `order` property.
- `order` property has the default value as `0`, the `more negative value` we provide - the more the element `moves to the upwards` and the `more positive value` we provide the element `moves to the downwards` in the arrangement (row/column).
	
	Default value - 0 ---       ![[Pasted image 20230410001033.png]]
	Positive value - 2 ---      ![[Pasted image 20230410001027.png]]
	Negative value - -1 ---   ![[Pasted image 20230410001031.png]]


## Adding Gaps

### gap

- `gap` property will add space between each item based on the value we pass to `gap`.

```css
.flex-container {
  gap: 10px;
}
```

We can also go a step further and define only a row gap or only a column gap.

```css
.flex-container {
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 250px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center;
  column-gap: 10px;
}
```
![[Pasted image 20230410001447.png]]
```css
.flex-container {
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 250px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: center;
  row-gap: 10px;
}
```
